What does it do?
================

This TYPO3 extension is an add-on to the `schema extension`_. It provides
additional `schema.org`_ terms related to `auto`_.

For more information about the schema extension have a look into the
:doc:`documentation <ext_schema:Index>`.


.. _vocabulary:

The schema.org vocabulary
=========================

The schema.org vocabulary is evolving, approx. every 2-3 times a year a new
version is `released`_. The TYPO3 extensions are updated when changes are made
to the according vocabulary. The classes for the type models and view helpers
are generated by the `schema-generator`_ library.


.. _release-management:

Release management
==================

This extension uses `semantic versioning`_ which basically means for you, that

*  Bugfix updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bug fixes or
   security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
*  Minor updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller
   tasks without breaking changes.
*  Major updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes which can be
   refactorings, features or bug fixes.
