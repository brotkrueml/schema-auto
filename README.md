# Extend the TYPO3 schema extension with auto-related terms

This TYPO3 extension is an add-on to the
[schema](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema) extension
which provides additional [schema.org](https://schema.org/) terms
related to auto: https://auto.schema.org/docs/auto.home.html.

You can use the terms as described in the
[schema documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/p/brotkrueml/schema/master/en-us/)
without further configuration.
